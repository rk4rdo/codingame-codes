## Description
You enter a section of road and you plan to rest entirely on your cruise
control to cross the area without having to stop or slow down.

The goal is to find the maximum speed (off speeding) that will allow you
to cross all the traffic lights to green.

Warning: You can not cross a traffic light the second it turns red!

Your vehicle enters the zone directly at the speed programmed on the
cruise control which ensures that it does not change anymore.

## Input
- Line 1: An integer speed for the maximum speed allowed on the portion
of the road (in km/h).
- Line 2: An integer lightCount for the number of traffic lights on the
road.
- lightCount next lines: 
	- An integer distance representing the distance of the traffic light
	from the starting point (in meters).
	- An integer duration representing the duration of the traffic light
	on each color.

A traffic light alternates a period of duration seconds in green and
then duration seconds in red.

All traffic lights turn green at the same time as you enter the area.

## Output
- Line 1: The integer speed (km/h) as high as possible that cross all
the green lights without committing speeding.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ speed ≤ 200
- 1 ≤ lightCount ≤ 9999
- 1 ≤ distance ≤ 99999
- 1 ≤ duration ≤ 9999
