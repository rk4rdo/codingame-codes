## Description
Provided with a set of bingo cards, and the order in which the numbers
will be called, output how many numbers need to be called before
somebody has a line, followed by how many numbers need to be called
before somebody has "bingo" (all numbers on their sheet filled in).

A bingo card is defined as a 5x5 set of numbers between 1 and 90.
The center of a bingo card is a "free space", meaning it is already
filled in - this is denoted with a 0 in this puzzle.

A line on the bingo card is defined as any row, column or diagonal of 5
numbers on the card.

## Input
- Line 1: An integer n for the number of bingo cards in play
- Next n*5 lines: The numbers bn on the bingo cards, separated by
spaces.
- Line n*5+1: The order in which the numbers cn will be called,
separated by a space. You are provided all 90 numbers.

## Output
- Line 1: The amount of numbers that need to be called before a bingo
card has a complete line.
- Line 2: The amount of numbers that need to be called before a bingo
card has a full house (all numbers filled).

## Constraints
- 0 < n ≤ 10000
- 0 ≤ bn ≤ 90 ("free space" is signified with a 0)
- 0 < cn ≤ 90
